The Permute Button on the calculator calculates how many different ways the given input,
be it digits, a number, or string of characters can be arranged.

If there is a number in the Spots box, the calculator will calculate how many ways the given
input can be arranged in that many spots.

If the Checkbox is checked, it takes the given number and calculate it as a string, and not a number.
This option is for objects where order does matter
